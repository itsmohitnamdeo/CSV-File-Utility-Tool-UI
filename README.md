# CSV-File-Utility-Tool-UI

This project is a CSV File Utility Tool with a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (UI) that allows users to perform various operations on CSV files. Users can read, filter, sort, aggregate data, write data, and check for palindromes, all through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface

## Features

- Read CSV and Display Data: Reads a CSV file and displays the first few rows.

- Filter Rows Based on Criteria: Allows filtering of rows based on user-defined conditions.

- Sort Rows by Column: Sorts rows in ascending or descending order based on a selected column.

- Aggregate Data (Sum, Average, etc.): Performs statistical calculations on a numeric column.

- Write to a New CSV File: Saves modified data into a new CSV file.

- Check for Palindromes: Identifies words that are palindromes and consist solely of the letters A, D, V, B, and N.

- Automated Tests: Includes unit tests to validate all functionalities.
